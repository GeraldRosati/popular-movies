First project for the Android Nanodegree on Udacity.

## How to Use
### The Movie Database API Key
This app retrieves movie information from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en). By default, an API key for The Movie Database is not provided. In order to obtain movie information, change the value of the `MOVIE_DB_API_KEY` variable in NetworkUtils.java to your unique API key.
