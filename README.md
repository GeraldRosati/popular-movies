## Usage Notes
### The Movie Database API Key
This app retrieves movie information from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en). By default, an API key for The Movie Database is not provided. In order to obtain movie information, change the value of the `MOVIE_DB_API_KEY` variable in NetworkUtils.java to your unique API key. 

### Sorting
The list of movies can be sorted based on Popularity or Rating. The sorting method can be changed in the overflow menu by clicking on "Display Order".
